# Esteban J. Valencia, MPH

Hello! I'm Esteban, a first-year PhD student in Population and Public Health at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.spph.ubc.ca/). My research interests revolve around two general questions: 

1. How do criminal-legal system operations (e.g., policing, incarceration, immigration enforcement, etc.) affect population health, particularly along axes of race-ethnicity, gender, and geography?
2. How can epidemologic and demographic research methods advance the projects of prison and police abolition?

Much of my career has focused on this intersection of public health research and critical criminal-legal system analysis. For two years I worked as a research analyst at the University of Washington School of Medicine supporting program evaluations of juvenile justice behavioral health interventions. 
<br />
<br />
Subsequently, as I began my MPH studies, I transitioned into a research assistantship under [Dr. Mary Kernic](https://epi.washington.edu/faculty/kernic-mary/) (PI) where I supported projects that examined the role of court processes in the epidemiology of intimate partner violence. While completing my MPH degree I also worked as a COVID-19 contact tracer for Public Health - Seattle & King County. My MPH thesis, entitled ["Examining the scope of homicide-suicide perpetrated by law-enforcement: A population-based retrospective study using multiple frames, 2003 - 2017"](https://digital.lib.washington.edu/researchworks/handle/1773/48028) was advised by Dr. Mary Kernic and [Dr. Thomas Lumley](https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/people/tlum005). 
<br />
<br />
Presently, I am a graduate trainee with the BC Children's Research Institute under the supervision of [Dr. Patricia Janssen](https://www.bcchr.ca/pjanssen).

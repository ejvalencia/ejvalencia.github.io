# Esteban J. Valencia, MPH

Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student in Population and Public Health at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.spph.ubc.ca/). My research interests revolve around two general questions: 

1. How do criminal-legal system operations (e.g., policing, incarceration, immigration enforcement, etc.) affect population health, particularly along axes of race-ethnicity, gender, and geography?
2. How can epidemiologic and demographic research methods advance the projects of prison and police abolition?

Prior to joining UBC, I worked for two years as a research analyst at the University of Washington School of Medicine, where I supported program evaluations of juvneile-justice behavioral health interventions. I received my MPH in epidemiology from the University of Washington School of Public Health, along with a graduate certificate in demographic methods from the UW Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology. As an MPH student I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Mary Kernic](https://epi.washington.edu/faculty/kernic-mary/) (PI) supporting projects that explored the role of court processes in the epidemiology of intimate partner violence. From 2020 - 2021 I also worked as a COVID-19 contact tracer for Public Health - Seattle & King County.

Presently, I am a graduate trainee with the BC Children's Research Institute under the supervision of [Dr. Patricia Janssen](https://www.bcchr.ca/pjanssen).

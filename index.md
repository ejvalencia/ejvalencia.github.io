# Esteban J. Valencia, MPH

Hello!

My name is Esteban (They/Them) and I am a third-year PhD Candidate in Population and Public Health at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.spph.ubc.ca/), working under the supervision of [Dr. Patricia Janssen](https://www.bcchr.ca/pjanssen). Presently, my research interests revolve around three related lines of inquiry:

1.	How do criminal-legal system policies and practices affect population health outcomes, particularly along axes of race and ethnicity, gender, and geography?
2.	How can we leverage epidemiologic and demographic research methods to advance the health and welfare of incarcerated peoples?
3.	How can we adapt quantitative research methods to better align with the needs of community-based and community-driven research?

## Dissertation Research

My dissertation will examine the complex health and service needs of provincially incarcerated women in British Columbia, and is organized around three aims. The first aim is to describe how the prevalence of physical, mental health, and substance-use related morbidities have changed over time -- particularly in relation to shifting correctional healthcare policy and the COVID-19 pandemic. The second aim is to characterize the clustering of individual morbidities into unique profiles of health and service needs. The third aim is to review how centeralizing correctional heatlhcare governance within Ministries of Health can improve the identification of healthcare needs among provincially incarcerated people. The overall goal of my research is to inform the development of responsive, coordianted support services for women entering and exiting the provincial carceral system. This work is supported by a [2023 CIHR Health Systems Impact Fellowship](https://cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/53687.html) in partnership with BC Mental Health and Substance Use Services.

## Professional Background

Beyond my dissertation research, I also serve as a data analyst at the [Centre for Gender and Sexual Health Equity (CGSHE)](https://cgshe.ca/). In this capacity, I support research faculty, students, and staff in designing and implementing statistical analysis plans relating to two community-based cohort studies: [An Evaluation of Sex Workers Health Access (AESHA)](https://cgshe.ca/research/community-based-cohorts-social-policy-research/aesha/) and [Sexual Health & HIV/AIDS: Longitudinal Womenâ€™s Needs Assessment (SHAWNA)](https://cgshe.ca/research/community-based-cohorts-social-policy-research/shawna/). Additionally, I lead the development of CGSHE's geospatial data infrastructure and support geospatial analyses across both AESHA and SHAWNA cohort studies.

Prior to joining UBC, I earned my MPH in Epidemiology with a concentration in Maternal and Child Health from the University of Washington. I also received a graduate certificate in Demographic Methods from the [UW Center for Studies in Demography and Ecology](https://csde.washington.edu/). My professional career has 




Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student in Population and Public Health at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.spph.ubc.ca/). My research interests revolve around two general questions:

1. How do operations of the criminal-legal system (e.g., policing, incarceration, immigration enforcement, etc.) affect population health, particularly along axes of race and ethnicity, gender, and geography?
2. How can epidemiologic and demographic research methods advance the projects of prison and police abolition?

Before joining UBC, I worked as a research analyst at the University of Washington School of Medicine, where I supported program evaluations of juvenile-justice behavioral health interventions. I earned my MPH in epidemiology from the University of Washington School of Public Health, along with a graduate certificate in demographic methods from the UW Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology. As an MPH student, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Mary Kernic](https://epi.washington.edu/faculty/kernic-mary/)(PI) supporting projects that explored the role of court processes in the epidemiology of intimate partner violence. From 2020 - 2020 I also worked as a COVID-19 contact tracer for Public Health - Seattle & King County.

Presently, I am a graduate trainee with the BC Children's Research Institute under the supervision of [Dr. Patricia Janssen](https://www.bcchr.ca/pjanssen).

# Esteban J. Valencia, MPH

Hello! I'm a first-year PhD student in Population and Public Health at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.spph.ubc.ca/). My research interests revolve around two general questions:

1. How do operations of the criminal-legal system (e.g., policing, incarceration, immigration enforcement, etc.) affect population health, particularly along axes of race and ethnicity, gender, and geography?
2. How can epidemiologic and demographic research methods advance the projects of prison and police abolition?

Before joining UBC, I worked as a research analyst at the University of Washington School of Medicine, where I supported program evaluations of juvenile-justice behavioral health interventions. I earned my MPH in epidemiology from the University of Washington School of Public Health, along with a graduate certificate in demographic methods from the UW Center for Studies in Demography & Ecology. As an MPH student, I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Mary Kernic](https://epi.washington.edu/faculty/kernic-mary/)(PI) supporting projects that explored the role of court processes in the epidemiology of intimate partner violence. From 2020 - 2020 I also worked as a COVID-19 contact tracer for Public Health - Seattle & King County.

Presently, I am a graduate trainee with the BC Children's Research Institute under the supervision of [Dr. Patricia Janssen](https://www.bcchr.ca/pjanssen).
